## The Fucking iPadOS Accident

My ipad mini4 was purchased at the end of 2015. It has been in service for more than 6 years, and the system has hardly been updated. The system often prompts that the system needs to be updated. On December 30, 2022, driven by the system annoyance and some software that cannot be used without updating, the system was updated under the prompt of the system. As a result, the system was always on the startup logo interface.

I went to the after-sales service to try to flash the machine but failed, so I had to return to the factory to test the hardware, but because the warranty period has expired. If within the warranty period, it is confirmed that there is a problem with the hardware after returning to the factory for inspection, the other party can ask the customer to choose whether to replace the hardware, but if the device has passed the warranty, if there is a problem with the hardware, the hardware must be replaced directly without asking the customer's will. What a fucking clause!

What am I doing wrong, I just did an update to the system, it's just that my device is out of warranty. Why the consequences of fucking system software problems need to be borne by consumers. What about my other devices, iphone6, mac2015, they are some old devices, and the system often prompts that their systems need to be updated, fuck it！

I'm having the exact same issue with my device：

Fucking iPadOS, fucking Apple after-sales service, and fucking overlord clauses, you are as disgusting as some government agencies, and the final interpretation is always in your hands!
